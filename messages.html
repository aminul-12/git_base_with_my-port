    <h1>ðŸ“¬ Reflections & Technological Vision</h1>

    <div class="msg-card">
        <h3>ðŸ”­ About my mind in-Future Impact of Technology</h3>
        <p>Technology is no longer confined to hardware or softwareâ€”itâ€™s becoming the heartbeat of modern civilization.
            The future will witness machines making ethical decisions, classrooms without borders, and healthcare
            systems powered by intelligent diagnostics. As AI, cloud infrastructure, and quantum computing evolve, they
            won't just speed up performanceâ€”theyâ€™ll redefine how societies communicate, protect, and progress.</p>
        <p>My interest lies specifically in the intersection of secure systems and educational accessibility. I believe
            scalable apps combined with privacy-first engineering can democratize access to knowledge, enabling students
            from any region to study, collaborate, and innovateâ€”regardless of economic or political barriers.</p>
        <p>Another key shift I observe is the decentralization of identity. Future authentication wonâ€™t rely solely on
            passwords or devicesâ€”itâ€™ll require adaptive security mechanisms powered by behavioral patterns, encrypted
            biometrics, and trusted federated systems. As a student of Computer Science, I want to lead initiatives that
            make these technologies trustworthy, transparent, and inclusive.</p>
        <p>Technologyâ€™s future must be guided not by profit, but by purpose. With climate concerns, misinformation, and
            inequality rising, engineers must take up the mantle of ethical transformation. I strive to be part of that
            movementâ€”where code serves humanityâ€™s deepest needs, not just its fastest transactions.</p>

    <div class="msg-card">
        <h3>ðŸ’¡ Why I Build</h3>
        <p>I don't just write codeâ€”I architect ideas. Every interaction, layout, and authentication flow on this
            portfolio reflects my commitment to clarity, empathy, and meaningful impact. Technology should empower the
            voiceless, simplify the complex, and inspire curiosity. My designs aim to do just that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="msg-card">
        <h3>ðŸŽ“ Scholarship Motivation</h3>
        <p>Pursuing higher studies abroad will allow me to expand this vision globally. I wish to study in an
            institution that values ethical engineering, interdisciplinary collaboration, and real-world research in
            digital systems. With the right mentorship and academic environment, I will contribute solutions that
            balance innovation with responsibility, scalability with sustainability.</p>
